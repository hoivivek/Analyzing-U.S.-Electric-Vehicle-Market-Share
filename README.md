## Project Overview
The goal is to analyze the growth and distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) across the United States using a dataset that includes vehicle registration counts for various fuel types (like EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, gasoline, and diesel) by state.


## Technology Stack
The analysis was performed using the following tools:

- Excel - Initial data review and validation
- MySQL - Data aggregation
- Tableau - Interactive dashboards, Geographic and comparative visualizations


## Key Analysis

1. The percentage of EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and Gasoline vehicles for each state
   In each state the percentage of Gasoline vehicles is more than compared to EV, PHEV, HEV. This highlights that while EV adoption is growing, the U.S. vehicle market is       still heavily reliant on traditional fuels.

2. Top 5 states with the highest EV adoption rate (EVs as a % of all registered vehicles)
   Top 5 states by EV adoption rate:
    - California
    - District of Columbia
    - Hawaii
    - Washington
    - Nevada
    These states consistently show higher EV adoption.

3. Last 5 states with least EV adoption rates
   Last 5 states by EV adoption rate:
   - Mississippi
   - North Dakota
   - Wyoming
   - South Dakota
   - West Virginia

4. EV adoption in California vs. other large states (e.g., Texas, Florida, New York)
       
   Compared to California leading with 3.410%, Texas with 0.90%, New York with 1.170% and Florida with 1.380 % California leads decisively due to:
   - Strong EV incentives
   - Extensive charging infrastructure
   - Aggressive environmental policies
   Other large states lag despite high total vehicle counts, indicating untapped EV growth potential.

5. Alternative fuels (biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen) usage
   
   Biodiesel - 0.98%, 
   Ethanol - 7.09%, 
   Hydrogen - 0.01%

  - Ethanol has meaningful adoption and plays a transitional role.
  - Biodiesel remains niche.
  - Hydrogen vehicles have an extremely limited presence, suggesting high infrastructure and adoption barriers.

  ### Visualizations

  2. Breakdown of Each Fuel type

  ## Key Insights
  
  Leading States
  -	California, DC, Hawaii, Washington, and Nevada are EV leaders
  -	These states benefit from early infrastructure investment and supportive policies
    
  Lagging States
  - Mississippi, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, West Virginia
  - These states show very low EV adoption percentages, often due to:
    - Limited charging infrastructure
    - Lower policy incentives
    - Rural travel patterns

  Policy Implications
  - EV adoption strongly correlates with infrastructure availability and incentives
  - High vehicle ownership alone does not guarantee EV growth


## Recommendation

Priority States for EV Infrastructure Investment
1. Texas
   -	Large total vehicle base
   -	EV adoption below 1%
   -	High potential impact from targeted charging infrastructure
2. Florida
  - Moderate EV adoption
  -	Large population and tourism-driven transportation demand
  -	Coastal environmental concerns increase EV relevance

3. New York
   -	Urban density supports EV usage
   - 	Adoption still trails leading states
   -	Infrastructure expansion could accelerate uptake

  Justification:
  These states combine:
  •	High vehicle volume
  •	Growing EV interest
  •	Infrastructure gaps that, if addressed, could significantly boost EV adoption.


## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that while EV adoption is accelerating in select states, the U.S. vehicle market remains dominated by gasoline-powered vehicles. Strategic infrastructure investments, targeted incentives, and state-level policy alignment are critical to accelerating nationwide EV adoption.
